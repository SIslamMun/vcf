# üöÄ VCF: Vibe Coding Fridays

Welcome to Vibe Coding Fridays - a collaborative space into AI-enhanced software development! Every Friday, we dive deep into cutting-edge AI coding tools, techniques, and workflows while building real solutions for high-performance computing and AI research.

## üéØ Mission

Transform how we think about programming by mastering human-AI collaboration in software development. Through hands-on exploration, we're discovering the most effective ways to leverage AI as a coding partner, not just a tool.

## üìÖ Program Overview

**When**: Every Friday, 10am-1pm CDT  
**Duration**: 12 weeks (Summer 2025)  
**Format**: 3-hour sessions combining tutorials, hands-on coding, and knowledge synthesis

### Three-Phase Journey

- **üèóÔ∏è Phase 1 (June)**: AI-Native Development Foundations
- **üé® Phase 2 (July)**: Individual AI Mastery  
- **üèÜ Phase 3 (August)**: Competitive AI Innovation

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop
- VS Code with Copilot Pro
- UV package manager: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- Access to [GRC Zulipchat](https://grc.zulipchat.com/)

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/grc-iit/vcf.git
cd vcf

# Initialize development environment
uv init
uv add --dev pytest ruff black

# Setup Docker development container
docker build -t vcf-dev .
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workspace vcf-dev
```

## üéØ Current Focus: Scifon-MCP

Our primary project is **Scifon-MCP** - an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that acts as intelligent memory and storage for AI-assisted developers. Think of it as a smart clipboard that understands scientific computing contexts.

## ü§ù Contributing

# 🚀 VCF: Vibe Coding Fridays

**Exploring the Future of AI-Powered Development**

Welcome to Vibe Coding Fridays - a collaborative journey into AI-enhanced software development! Every Friday, we dive deep into cutting-edge AI coding tools, techniques, and workflows while building real solutions for high-performance computing and AI research.

## 🎯 Mission

Transform how we think about programming by mastering human-AI collaboration in software development. Through hands-on exploration, we're discovering the most effective ways to leverage AI as a coding partner, not just a tool.

## 📅 Program Overview

**When**: Every Friday, 10am-1pm CDT  
**Duration**: 12 weeks (Summer 2025)  
**Format**: 3-hour sessions combining tutorials, hands-on coding, and knowledge synthesis

### Three-Phase Journey

- **🏗️ Phase 1 (June)**: AI-Native Development Foundations
- **🎨 Phase 2 (July)**: Individual AI Mastery  
- **🏆 Phase 3 (August)**: Competitive AI Innovation

```

## 🎯 Current Focus: Scifon-MCP

Our primary project is **Scifon-MCP** - an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that acts as intelligent memory and storage for AI-assisted HPC workflows. Think of it as a smart clipboard that understands scientific computing contexts.

**Key Features in Development**:
- AI-enhanced data persistence and retrieval
- HPC-specific data type understanding
- Multi-user collaborative memory spaces
- Integration with popular HPC tools and workflows
